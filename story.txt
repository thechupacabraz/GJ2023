Cutscene 1: broken ass buildings, smoky atmosphere, sand dune, sorrowful winds

narrator(at a slow pace): "It is the year 2025. Mankind has succumbed to its greed resulting in the destruction of everything around it. I won’t be too dramatic about it, all the plants died. DEAD. NEHEHEHEHEHEHE" 

Cutscene 2: fucked up earth, two meteorites flying from opposite sides in space, crash onto the planet, craters happen, BOOM BOOM EVERYWHERE. 
MC wakes up from sleep due to the crash sound. 

Game Scene 1: MC gets the choice to go east or west and he can’t go back after moving in either direction. (east is dark, west is light)
